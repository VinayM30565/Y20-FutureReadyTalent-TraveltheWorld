# Y20-FutureReadyTalent-TraveltheWorld


Make a Web application with a chatbot function that tourists can use to learn more about vacation spots and deals in a specific area.

The project utilises a number of Azure services.

The Azure Power Virtual Agent 2) An Azure static web app

I used a virtual agent using AI to generate question and response pairings. 
To the static, I added a virtual agent with AI capabilities.
Then I hosted using Static Web App Service. Full stack web apps are automatically generated and deployed to Azure using a service called Azure Static Web Apps.

Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps:

The following are some of the primary attributes of Azure Static Web Apps that led me to select this offering:

1. Web hosting for static content like JavaScript, CSS, and pictures.

2. Azure Functions provides built-in API support with the option to link an already-existing Azure Functions app with a standard account.

3. Outstanding builds and deploys are triggered by repository updates thanks to GitHub and Azure DevOps integration.

4. Global delivery of static content that is closer to your users.

5. Free SSL certificates that automatically renew.

6. Individual domains to brand your application.
